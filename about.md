My name is Joakim and I love to build and develop things out of thin air: [software](https://github.com/joakimjm), [music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0btBp6srUORXtz5XuKtNim), [health](https://oxygym.dk/), [relationships](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joakimjm/) and people.

I live with my wife in Copenhagen and while I work for [Copenhagen Optimization](https://copenhagenoptimization.com/), this blog, its content and opinions are my own.

I work to inspire simplicity and efficiency, so anyone can live fulfilled lives with minimal effort. I do it through friendship, leadership and building useful software.

# Background

Combining the engineering disciplines from the Technical University of Denmark with the managerial and economic perspectives from Copenhagen Business School has given me a nuanced perspective on to _how to business_.

I've always found it natural to empathize with and bridge what's important to engineering with what's important to the business. Maybe that's why I've always been excited about business-to-business software as a service products.

Starting my first part-time software job during my studies with no tangible software work experience in 2008, I was nudged into teaching and mentoring in 2010 and have continued to enjoy that aspect of work in every role I've had.

In 2019 my career path shifted into leadership and since then, being somewhat contrarian, I've been searching and finding ways to keep organizational power in the hands of the people doing the work.

# Other stuff important to me

My wife loves to travel, and I gladly go with her. We love to spend time on food, friends and family. Together we coach general fitness classes every Sunday morning.

My approach to life is generalistic. If I had motto it would be something in the lines of "don't suck at anything".

If you don't suck at anything, you can win crossfit competitions, play the last unmanned but essential instrument in the improvised band, cook tasty food without a recipe, solve problems for good with code, write a memorable speech and hopefully live long and prosper. That's the general idea at least.
