I vividly recall the disappointment of being handed a beautifully wrapped present, knowing immediately from the weight and firmness that it was a gift-wrapped chore. The book I got as a "present" was Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone for Christmas. It's a wonderful story, but I didn't read the book until a school assignment forced me to read a longer novel and write about it. Though slightly delayed, the present finally presented its value, as it saved me the trouble of trying to find a book for the assignment. It still felt like a chore reading it.

It's not that I didn't enjoy reading to learn about topics that I thought was _interesting_, but as soon as it felt remotely like a chore, motivation would dissipate.

At university I discovered that I got the most out of being present at lectures. I preferred auditory learning - to _hear_ how stuff works and then apply it. Of course this made my learning very dependant on the quality of the lecturers and their capacity to teach and engage students. Ironically, it seemed like many university lecturers had never learned how to teach, but that's a different story.

Meanwhile 3G mobile data, iPhones and podcasts became abundant. The first few podcasts I listened to were HowStuffWorks, Software Engineering Daily, The Changelog and .NET Rocks! and I found that podcasts were a great source of inspiration. However the easily digestable format mostly only scratched the surface of what I would have to dive into on my own to learn more.

When my responsibilities in Copenhagen Optimization began to expand outside of my comfortzone with leadership tasks and the motivation and wellbeing of technical colleagues, it started to feel like I was in over my head. No blog post or podcast seemed to answer any of my questions, many of which were about myself, so I felt a need grow personally and learn fast to develop some kind of intuition about what my responsibilities entailed.

In September 2017 I listened to my first audiobook with academic content. It felt just like an insight dense, in-depth and differently satiating "podcast", and by the end of the year I had consumed five more books about human nature and leadership. It's like ingesting a university semester curriculum worth of information within three months, all while riding my bike!

In [The Art of Impossible](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Impossible-Peak-Performance-Primer/dp/0062977539), Steven Kotler calls it the Return On Investment on reading. As in, what's the trade you make in time you spend consuming with the time it took the author to produce (researching, writing, editing, etc.):

| Resource | Production | Consumption |
|----------|-----------:|------------:|
| Blogs    |  3 minutes |      3 days |
| Articles | 20 minutes |    4 months |
| Books    |    5 hours |    15 years |

Sure, it may be crudely generalized, but it resonated completely with my gut feeling of getting more out of my time with audiobooks than podcasts. For many people, it's such an easy transition to make, because listening to podcasts while commuting, running, cooking or cleaning is already an integrated habit.

When I need a break from academic material, there are even more wonderful biographies and fiction book series that keep me both entertained and inspired.
