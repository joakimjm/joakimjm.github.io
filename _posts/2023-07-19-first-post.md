Here we go! Further than ever with a blog. Maybe it will work this time.

# The purpose
What inspired me to get this blog started, was [a presentation by Scott Hanselman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEGFmojptas) where he references [a blog post](https://blog.jonudell.net/2007/04/10/too-busy-to-blog-count-your-keystrokes/) by Jon Udell that, in short, is about getting more value out of the effort you've already exerted into writing a long e-mail, guide or other form of deliberate string of sentences.

In the age of the internet, those references might be relics by now, and even though _blogging_ is a different universe than it was 10 years ago, the message still holds true. By leaving thoughts and ideas in e-mails, Dropbox Papers or my Notes app, I guarantee that the audience will be limited and thus that the words die alone. By moving the words out here, the guarantee becomes a probability instead.

I'm all about simplicity and I'm too [lazy](http://thethreevirtues.com/) to enjoy repeating myself, so I really hope I can adhere to this challenge of putting words here that don't belong in code, on wiki pages or any other obvious place.

I don't expect any followers, so I wish me luck!
